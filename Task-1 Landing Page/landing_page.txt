				<h3>Let's tackle climate changes together</h3>
				<p>In early April, 29 countries pledged more than $5 billion to the UN-backed Global Environment Facility. The Fund said this was “record support, providing a major boost to international efforts to protect biodiversity and curb threats to climate change, plastics and toxic chemicals”.</p>

					<h3>Humans are responsible for global warming</h3>
					<p>Climate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.</p>

					<h3>Every increase in global warming matters</h3>
					<p>In a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5°C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a livable climate. Yet policies currently in place point to a 2.8°C temperature rise by the end of the century.</p>

					<h3>We face a huge challenge but already know many solutions</h3>
					<p>Many climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.</p>

					<h3>world environmental day</h3>
					<p>World Environment Day 2023 is a reminder that people’s actions on plastic pollution matters. The steps governments and businesses are taking to tackle plastic pollution are the consequence of this action.
						It is time to accelerate this action and transition to a circular economy.					
						It is time to #BeatPlasticPollution..</p>

					<h3>co2 emissions</h3>
					<p>Billions of tons of CO2 are released into the atmosphere every year as a result of coal, oil, and gas production. Human activity is producing greenhouse gas emissions at a record high, with no signs of slowing down.</p>

					<h3>We can pay the bill now, or pay dearly in the future</h3>
					<p>Climate action requires significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for industrialized countries to fulfil their commitment to provide $100 billion a year to developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.</p>
